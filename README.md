The "Easy Install" installs Lucent Core (with wallet functionality) and the option to set it up as a masternode as well with ease!

Current available "Easy Install" options:

- [Ubuntu 16.04](https://github.com/LucentCoin/Lucent/releases) found in the official Lucent Core GitHub Releases.
  - *Note*: I did not write the Ubuntu Bash Script.
